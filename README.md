Script will generate absolutely random SOLANA wallets and check transaction count on them.
If anything above zero is found, private key and address will be saved on Desktop in 'wallets.txt' file
Use paid RPC servers to get close to zero delays (else you will be rejected or banned)

If you are lucky a wallet with actual value theoretically could be generated.
